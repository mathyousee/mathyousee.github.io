![Is it worth the time?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time_2x.png)

I’ve loved this visual aid for years. It still surprises me how often I will pull up this image up either to share with someone, or to give myself a reminder when I’m overthinking “productivity stuff”.

I’m sharing it here in case you haven’t seen it (or something like it) or so it can be a little reminder. There are 3 common outcomes I arrive at when consulting the chart:

-   Typically for personal productivity, it’s not worth the time
-   If it can help multiple people multiple times per day, it’s probably worth the time
-   It’s always worth the time if I can eliminate the task (can I just do that?)
