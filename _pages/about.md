I live in Wayzata, MN, with my wife Jess, daughter Emelia, and dog Stormie. I’m not much for most social media (such as Facebook, it’s just not that appealing to me), but I do like to podcast and create content.

Time is precious and I don't like wasting it, so I've tuned my habits both personally and professionally in an ongoing effort to spend that time on what matters--and I love sharing what I've learned with others through speaking and writing.​
