VS Code has become my go-to text editor and scratch pad for little copy/paste snippets. This edged out my previous favorite Notepad++ in 2019 after I explored some of the capabilities available in VS Code. This includes:

- Markdown preview window - I like the simplicity of separating structure from visual design, which Markdown helps with in a huge way.
- Outline view - For files that have structure, like different heading styles in Markdow, the Outline makes it easy to jump to the right part of an open document
- Extensions - The large selection, configurability, and ease of installing extensions that help work with different projects is great. This was my first exposure to a "lint" and "linting"--a way to analyze structure in the "code" (even if that code is something like a Markdown file.)
