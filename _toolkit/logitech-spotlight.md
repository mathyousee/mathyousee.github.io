The Logitech Spotlight presenter handles the basics of advancing and traversing slides. It also packs some great capabilities:

- Rapid recharge - no need to carry extra batteries. In 2 minutes it's charged enough to handle a long presentation
- Screen spotlight - Dim most of the screen to create a spotlight effect, drawing attention to a specific part of the slide
- Click/interactivity - If presenting a demo, click buttons/links with the handheld presenter
