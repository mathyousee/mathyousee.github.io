You know what Office 365 is. I actually get a subscription through work AND pay for my own Office 365 Business Premium subscription that I use for my personal projects. I've been doing the latter since before I started at Microsoft (and before I got an employee discount).

The reality is, this is the best overall suite of office productivity software, which has grown to include productivity and communications tools:

- Planner
- To Do
- Traditional office apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote)
- Exchange + Outlook Web App
- Teams
- Power Platform (Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI)
