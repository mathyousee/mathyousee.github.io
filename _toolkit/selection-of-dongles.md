There are a few USB-C dongles I keep nearby for easy connectivity when I'm on the road. These work with my Surface Book 2, HP Spectre, and Surface Go:

- HP port replicator (VGA, HDMI, USB-A, USB-C)
- Network adapter - for when I need to hardwire in a single device
- Extra HDMI connector - just in case
